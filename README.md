Learn Git: Commit
The term commit is fundamental to how Git functions as a version control system. It is important to first understand what a commit is before learning how to perform the Git commit command and how to perform other actions related to commits in Git.

What is a Git commit?
In Git, a commit is a snapshot of your repo at a specific point in time.

To help further understand what a Git commit is, we need to review your Working Directory vs your Staging Directory and how files changes are reflected in your Git repository.

Think of your working directory as your “in progress” working area; here, created or modified files are not yet reflected in your Git repo. Changes made to files in your working directly only exist locally on your machine.

Git Stage Files
In order to apply changes from your working directory to your Git repository, you must first stage them in your staging directory.

From here, your changes can be saved in your repo by performing a Git commit.


Now, each Git commit will represent a snapshot of your repo at that point in time, and all of your commits will come together to form your repository’s history.


Git Workflow
Traditionally, a Git workflow will involve the following steps:

Make changes in your working directory
Stage changes in your staging directory
Commit changes to apply them to your Git repository
OK, now that we’ve answered the question of what is a Git commit !
